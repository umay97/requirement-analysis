# requirement-analysis
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# What is Requirement Analysis? 
The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developerâ€™s ability to:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

 # Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
 Key Highlights
Real-world Application: The project emulates real-life software requirement analysis tasks to give learners hands-on experience with documentation and project planning.
Comprehensive Documentation: Develop detailed explanations of key concepts like requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
Visual Representations: Use diagrams to illustrate system actors and interactions for a clear and concise depiction of requirements.
