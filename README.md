# requirement-analysis
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# What is Requirement Analysis? 
The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer‚Äôs ability to:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

 # Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Real-world Application: The project emulates real-life software requirement analysis tasks to give learners hands-on experience with documentation and project planning.
Comprehensive Documentation: Develop detailed explanations of key concepts like requirement gathering, functional vs. 
non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
Visual Representations: Use diagrams to illustrate system actors and interactions for a clear and concise depiction of requirements.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that stakeholder needs are correctly understood, documented, and validated. Below are the five key activities involved:

### ‚Ä¢ Requirement Gathering

* Collect information from stakeholders, end-users, and domain experts.
* Use techniques like interviews, questionnaires, observations, and document analysis.
* Establish the business goals and context for the project.

### ‚Ä¢ Requirement Elicitation

* Engage actively with stakeholders to uncover explicit and implicit requirements.
* Conduct workshops, brainstorming sessions, and prototyping.
* Focus on understanding pain points, expectations, and constraints.

### ‚Ä¢ Requirement Documentation

* Clearly document functional and non-functional requirements in structured formats.
* Use tools like user stories, use case descriptions, and requirement specifications.
* Ensure consistency, clarity, and traceability in the documentation.

### ‚Ä¢ Requirement Analysis and Modeling

* Examine requirements for completeness, feasibility, and relevance.
* Identify and resolve conflicts or ambiguities.
* Represent requirements visually using models and diagrams (e.g., use case diagrams, flowcharts).

### ‚Ä¢ Requirement Validation

* Verify that requirements align with business objectives and user needs.
* Review and confirm with stakeholders through walkthroughs and reviews.
* Ensure that requirements are testable and traceable for future implementation.
 Here‚Äôs the content you can directly insert into your `README.md` under a new section titled **‚ÄúTypes of Requirements‚Äù** with two clearly defined subsections:


##  Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are typically divided into **Functional** and **Non-functional** categories. Understanding this distinction helps in designing systems that are both capable and reliable.

###  Functional Requirements

**Definition:**
Functional requirements describe what the system should do ‚Äî the features, services, and operations it must support. These are directly related to the user's needs and the tasks the system must perform.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**

* Users can register and log in using their email and password.
* A customer can book a service (e.g., a hotel room or an appointment) for a specific date and time.
* Users can cancel or modify their bookings before a certain deadline.
* Administrators can view and manage all bookings.
* The system sends email confirmations after successful bookings.

###  Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**
Non-functional requirements specify how the system performs its functions. They include performance, usability, security, reliability, and other quality attributes.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**

* The system shall respond to booking requests within 2 seconds under normal load.
* User data must be encrypted during transmission and at rest.
* The platform must be accessible 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.
* The interface shall support responsive design for both mobile and desktop users.
* The system must support up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
  
** Use Case Diagrams üìä**
Objective: Visual representation of interactions between users and the system.

What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
Creating Use Case Diagrams:

Identify actors (e.g., guest, registered user, admin).
Define use cases (e.g., search properties, book property, manage listings).
Draw interactions between actors and use cases.
Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
